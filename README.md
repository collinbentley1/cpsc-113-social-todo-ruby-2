Initialize the application on Cloud9 with
        rails server -b $IP -p $PORT


I followed the tutorial on railstutorial.org, and you can see this attempt
at https://github.com/collinbentley1/cpsc-113-social-todo-ruby

But in the end, I got to the point where my app wouldn't even start, so
I cloned the code from the railstutorial.


Unfortunately, I have no idea how to make the Complete and Collaboration functions
to work. I met with April, and we worked through the problem, but I wasn't able
to implement these functions on my own. I really wanted to learn Rails, and I
followed the entire railstutorial.org guide, but by the end, I still did not have
the skills to add these features. However, I do feel that I learned so much
from doing this project. There is a collaborator function that you'll find on the
users page. This allows rails to create a relationship between users, and once
this relationship has been created, the feed for the follower will update with
the posts of the followed. I wish I knew how I could make this happen using
the form, as was required. April and I worked through some code that is currently
commented out in the micropost_controller, but I'm still not confident enough
to solve the collaborator issue. I'd like to find the time with either Kyle
or one of the TA's to be able to fully understand the issue.
